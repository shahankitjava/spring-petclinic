# Spring PetClinic -- Rewrite Technical Debt Remediation Sample

This is an example project that shows how to get started with Rewrite to automatically perform framework migrations and eliminate technical debt! The default branch (2.1.x) contains a slightly messier form of the last modification made to the famous [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) sample in the Spring Boot 1.5.x line.

To see how this repository can be used, check out the [OpenRewrite quickstart guide](https://docs.openrewrite.org/running-recipes/getting-started).
